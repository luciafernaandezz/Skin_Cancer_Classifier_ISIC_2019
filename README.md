# Skin Cancer Classifier (ISIC 2019)

This project focuses on using **deep learning** to classify different types of skin lesions from the **ISIC 2019 dataset**.  
It was developed as a learning exercise to understand how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) work and how they can be applied to medical image analysis.

## Summary
In this project, I worked on setting up and training a CNN model for image classification.  
The goal was to understand each step of the process from loading the dataset and preprocessing the images, to compiling and training the network.  
The project was based on existing code, which I recompiled and modified to learn how the model works and how to interpret its results.
